# JBank
A web app used for managing and processing job applications


I.	REQUIREMENTS
a.	The zipped file containing the tool (JBank.zip)
b.	Internet Explorer 7 or later
c.	Fully Configured E-mail Client (e.g. Microsoft Outlook 2003 or later)
i.	Using Outlook with Gmail
ii.	Using Outlook with Yahoo!

II.	INTRODUCTION
The goal of this project is to help job applicants manage their applications by having a database for storing and monitoring job applications in a more systematic way, which can reduce the time and effort through re-using of the stored e-mail templates, job details, and the ability to send out mails in batch form based on the selected criteria.
User inputs can be very minimal (min. of 3 details per job e.g. Job Title, E-mail Address, etc.) which can help them store hundreds or even thousands of job applications in a day.
This web application is safe to use. All saved data are stored locally.  E-mail is secured as it will be using your computerâ€™s default e-mail client. I suggest using of MS Outlook.
